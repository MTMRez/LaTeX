The dataset was extracted from firms residing in three different innovation cluster regions of Korea. All the data in this article are based on firm level questionnaire in the innovation cluster regions, with the exception of the firm survival information extracted from the National Tax Service of Korea and industry information from “Statistics Korea”.
